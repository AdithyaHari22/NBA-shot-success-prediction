# NBA Shot Success Prediction

This repository contains a project that predicts NBA shot success using advanced shot metrics. The project leverages several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Artificial Neural Networks, XGBoost, and LightGBM) to analyze and predict the likelihood of a successful shot based on contextual game factors and engineered features.

## About the Project

In modern NBA analytics, predicting the success of a shot can provide valuable insights for teams and coaches. This project:
- Utilizes a dataset comprising shot data from the NBA 2021â€“2024 seasons.
- Extracts and engineers features such as shot distance, player location, shot type, defender proximity, relative shot difficulty, and congestion proxy.
- Implements multiple machine learning algorithms to benchmark performance and draw insights.
- Evaluates models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Data Documentation
## Data Source

This project uses the [NBA Shots Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/nba-shots?resource=download) from Kaggle, which contains NBA data spanning the 2004 to 2024 seasons. For the scope of this project, the data from the 2021 season till the 2024 season has been used. Please refer to the dataset page for more details and licensing information.

For further information on the data used in this dataset, refer to the DATA_DESCRIPTION.md file.
